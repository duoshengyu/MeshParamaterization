# MeshParamaterization
This is a Corotation FEM elasticity, Spatial Hashing for collision detetion 
and collision respon implement.

Platform:           Windows 10

Develop Tool:       Visual Studio 2013

Program language:   C++  OpenGL

External libraries: glfw glew OpenMesh eigen

usage:

1.Download zip or clone this repository.

2.Open "OpenGL.sln" using Visual Studio 2013(Only support version 2013 now).

3.Change the Configuration to Release.

4.Run.
In this step you may see "something.dll are not in your compute" something like this,
go "lib" sub folder and copy the "something.dll" file to "Release" folder.After this,
it should work.
  
For Corotation FEM I use the code form https://code.google.com/archive/p/opencloth/.
